## Project 1: T's Euphoria 
Smoothie making game based in Sadove
#### How to run my code
Run euphoria.py and mituna.py. You must have the library arcade installed either through virtual environment or in your local machine.
#### Motivation
I personally enjoy playing food serving games. I spend most of my time at Sadove and I know how busy Euphoria can be, so I wanted to make a simulation of it.
#### To Do:

1. Welcome Screen
2. Sadove set up: Euphoria, piano, sprite
3. Smoothie Making Game Screen

#### In the process:

1. Creating the animation and on_update function for the welcome screen to transition into the sadove setup.
2. I am still trying to figure out how to make a float, walking animation.
3. I have two .py files where for the first two screens 

#### Questions:

1. What is import os? I was trying to make it clickable and the screen would update but the example code had an import os. 
2. How to make the screen disappear on right click?
